Ideas
=====
* Half a sheet of book covers. Close crops. Name the book. (Just books. No movies, albums. Include kids' books). Perhaps use books which were movies.
* Two faces sliced into 3, perhaps with a link. Maybe an app will do this.
* A page of logos (perhaps themed e.g. around the Mad Men era)
* Album covers
