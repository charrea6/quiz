_Perhaps used as ongoing clues between rounds with reducing points for correct answer_.


Example: Martin Sheen
---------------------


* I was born in Ohio
* I was born in 1940 (and am still alive - hopefully!)
* I have been arrested many, many times.
* My left arm was crushed by forceps at birth and I still have limited movement
* Something from a movie. Play the music from Badlands?
* Something from Apocalypse Now. Heart attack reference?
* I nearly played Michael Corleone in The Godfather, but I said to Francis Ford Coppola, "If you don't use Al Pacino in this part, it would be like benching Joe DiMaggio in his prime"
* I am the Lord your God, you shall not have strange Gods before me. (West Wing reference)
* I have never been nominated for an Academy Award, but Emmys yes.
* I love being Spanish as much as I love being Irish. And I love being Irish.
* I support the Democratic Party in the U.S.
