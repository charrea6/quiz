General notes/ideas etc.
========================

In between rounds, show progressively easier clues to a person. Each team can guess each round and get progressively less points. Extra answer space at bottom of each round. (HF)


Music round ideas
-----------------
Note: we need variety here. All age type/genre.
* Songs whose titles are cocktail ingredients e.g. Irish Coffee (variety is poor here)
  * WHISKEY in the jar - Thin Lizzy
  * BROWN SUGAR - Stones
  * CREAM - Prince
  * Heart of GLASS - Blondie
  * COFFEE and TV - Blur

Ideas for other rounds/themes
-----------------------------
* Food and drink: Celeb chefs, drink, cocktail components, ingredients, national dishes.
* TV & Radio
* Children’s culture. Novels, movies, cartoons, toys, - from all eras.
* Nerd central. Electronics. Games. Computers.
* Have I got news for you? The year that was.
  * Missing word round – guest publication = Colden Common community paper?
* Crossword format
* Pass around some obscure objects to identify
  * Perhaps Lego constructions.
* CBBC theme tunes.
* Use kids’ shows as themes for rounds. Numberjacks. Horrible Histories.
* Extreme weather round
* Double entendres round. Every answer rude.
* Marwell Zoo theme. Name the baby animals.
* Songs mixed up
  * One sequence of song snippets with a few words in each song – together forms a sentence. Hard to do.
* Countdown conundrum – with music
* Generation Game ideas
  * memory test: sequence of images like cuddly toy, sodastream etc
  * Make sausages ??? Who said this? ;)
* Haircuts. Famous haircuts. Ollie
* Famous children/siblings
* Hampshire celebrities.

Process
-------
Have the marking/scoring lag the question sheets by one round for smaller gaps between rounds. Then have an extra round at the end hats quick to mark. But teams marking teams leads to good banter.


Miscellanous ideas/themes or half-formed/silly ideas (sorry, no offence)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Record a “kids band” performing songs
* What happens next? Video sequence: e.g. Nick cycling along, video shows various hazards like pothole, child crossing road etc. Answer attacked by gorilla, gorilla steals bike.
* A smells round
* Through the Keyhole round. Who lives in a house like this? Lo-fi videos of fake celeb houses.
